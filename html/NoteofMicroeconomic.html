<h1>Individual Decision Making</h1>
<p>There are two ways modeling: individual preferences relation and choice rule.</p>
<h2>Preference Relation</h2>
<p>Preference relation focuses on two elements in set $X$ one time.</p>
<h2>Choice Rule</h2>
<p>Preference relation focuses on  a subset containing arbitrary number of elements in set $X$ one time.</p>


<h2>Welfare Evaluation of Economic Changes</h2>
<p>Welfare econometic is related to value judgement.This chapter focues on the welfare change of consumer under the economic environment change $(p,w)\to(p',w')$.</p>
<h5>An intuitive thought</h5>
<p>we have the indirect utility funcitions $v(p,w)$.We can get the change of $v(p,w)$ easily,but the utility is not unique.The value of utility is useless.</p>
<h5>Another way</h5>
<p>We know the welfare change is from $v(p',w')(u')$ to $v(p,w)(u)$.Under some price level $\bar{p}$,the expenditure change is $e(\bar{p},u')-e(\bar{p},u)$.Because of the expenditure function is monofonically increasing to $w$, it is another measure of utility.</p>
<p>And if we do like so,the change of wealth is easy to measure.We will focue on the change of price $p$ from now.</p>
<p>The problem is the price level $\bar{p}$.The propite price level $\bar{p}$ can be $p'$ or $p$.</p>
